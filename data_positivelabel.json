There are other factors, too, said Hannah Meyers, a fellow and director of policing and public safety at the conservative Manhattan Institute. A state discovery law from 2019 burdened prosecutors, leading to increases in dismissed cases and other outcomes, including downgrading charges, she said. The law requires prosecutors to share their evidence with defense attorneys quickly — within 20 days if a defendant is in jail — or risk having the case dismissed, though extensions are granted.",

Here is the relevant portion of the conversation:  McKenna: Would you promise — the Biden administration, along with some Republican support, just passed a piece of gun control legislation that is going to try to entice states to adopt red flag laws? Would you — in exchange for dollars from the federal government. Would you pledge not to take that money, and not to encourage the Republican Assembly and Senate to pass red flag laws? Michels: The federal government wants to attach dollars to some agenda that they have, and we won’t take it if I don’t agree with it. … I own a lot of guns and I know how to use them properly. Red flag laws, you know, people are entitled to due process. You just can’t have somebody make a complaint against you, and … your Second Amendment right be taken away.

We went back to the full hourlong debate, posted on YouTube by forum sponsor WISN-TV, Channel 12, to see it all in context. Michels was responding to a question from an audience member who was described as an advocate for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.   The question:  \"What’s your plan for reducing and/or eliminating the repeat acts of gun violence from those who have minor convictions and are still able to possess and/or purchase firearms in the state of Wisconsin?\"   The answer from Michels:  \"Yeah, so like I said, guns haven’t changed, society has changed. And I want to make sure that law abiding gun owners aren’t having their guns confiscated because an angry ex, ex-spouse, makes a complaint. ‘Oh, he made a threat to me and then the police have to go confiscate his guns.’ The Second Amendment is constitutional. It’s a right given by the Constitution to bear arms, and I will support the Second Amendment. I believe what we have to do is enforce the gun laws that are on the books.\"",

The quote  \"You know, testing is a double-edged sword. We’ve tested now 25 million people. It’s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. German’s done a lot. South Korea’s done a lot. They called me, they said the job you’re doing (trails off). Here’s the bad part. When you’re testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please.’\"",
